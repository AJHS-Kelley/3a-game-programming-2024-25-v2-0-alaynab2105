# Loops, Alayna Brewer, v0.0
import random # import the random module for us to use.
# Generally put all your import statements at the top.

# TWO TYPES OF LOOPS 
# for <-- Used when you know how many loops you'll need.
# while <-- Used when you do not know how many loops you'll need .

# for looop is like Go Fish, you search each card for what the player asked.
# while loop is like musical chairs, you move around until the music stops.

# EACH TRIP THROUGH THE ENTIRE LOOP IS CALLED AN interation
# "iterate through the list" means use a for loop

# for loop Example -- Iterating a list
# fruits = [" apple", "banana", "strawberry", "tomato"]
# for eachFruit in fruits:
#     print(eachFruit)

# continue Keyword -- Skips the current iteration and then finishes the loop.
# fruits =["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "tomato"]
# for eachFruit in fruits:
#     if eachFruit == "banana":
#        continue
#     print(eachFruit)

# break Keyword -- Immediately exit the loop.
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry","tomato"]
# for eachFruit in fruits:
#     if each fruit == "banana":
#        break
#     print(eachFruit)

# # for loops using range ().  range(x) is EXCLUSIVE, it starts at 0 and ends at x - 1
# for i in range(10): # range is 0 - 9
#     print(i)

# # Might not always want to start at zero.
# for i in range(10, 100): #
#     print(i)

# Not want to count by 1 -- RARE
# for i in range(10, 100, 5): # 10 = start, 100 - 1 = stop, 5 = # to count by 
#     print(i)

# # Sometimes you're not done writing the loops.
# for x in range(10):
#     pass # tells Python this loops isn't finished, don't freak out.

# while loops -- Musical Chairs 
playerScore = 0
counter = 0
while playerScore < 100: # Run as long as this is True.
     print(f"Starting: {playerScore}")
     playerscore += random.randint(1, 100)
     print(f"After: {playerScore}")
     counter += 1
     print(f"Counter: {counter}")
