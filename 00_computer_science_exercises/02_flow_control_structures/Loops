# Loops, Alayna Brewer, v0.0
import random # import the random module for us to use.
# Generally put all your import statements at the top.

# TWO TYPES OF LOOPS 
# for <-- Used when you know how many loops you'll need.
# while <-- Used when you do not know how many loops you'll need .

# for looop is like Go Fish, you search each card for what the player asked.
# while loop is like musical chairs, you move around until the music stops.

# EACH TRIP THROUGH THE ENTIRE LOOP IS CALLED AN interation
# "iterate through the list" means use a for loop

# for loop Example -- Iterating a list
# fruits = [" apple", "banana", "strawberry", "tomato"]
# for eachFruit in fruits:
#     print(eachFruit)

# continue Keyword -- Skips the current iteration and then finishes the loop.
# fruits =["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "tomato"]
# for eachFruit in fruits:
#     if eachFruit == "banana":
#        continue
#     print(eachFruit)
